# Experiments
Documentation for all modeling experiments, including EDA, feature engineering, parameter tuning, model selection and etc.. 
Includes the takeaways and analysis of each run, key metrics and performance indicators, and the next steps. Next steps can link to github issues for tracking purpose. 
Each experiment should be documented in a separate markdown file.

This page should include a summary and generic overview of all experiments.
